Hi, my name is Christopher Pool.
I’m interested in full-stack web development.
I’m currently learning front-end development. While I have a good base knowledge of how to make most front-end websites, I'm specifically trying to improve
  on UX, best practices, and optimization at the moment. 
I’m very eager to collaborate on any type of web project, though I do doubt how much assistance I could be currently. 
Feel free to reach me on discord @ChristopherPool#3641
