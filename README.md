Hi, my name is Christopher Pool and I’m interested in full-stack web development.

I’m currently learning front-end development. While I have a good base knowledge of how to make a front-end website, I'm specifically trying to improve
  on UX, best practices, and optimization at the moment. As well as other more specific front-sided things such as forms, video players, SEO, search algorithms, API post requests, and more. 
  
I’m very eager to collaborate on any type of web project, though I do doubt how much assistance I could be currently, unless your a bit of an amateur like me.  

I'm mainly interested in finding other people who are still somewhat new to programming and are looking to improve. I think it would be very beneficial to have other like-minded people who are also very determined to become the best developer they can be. I believe this would be much easier with multiple people. For instance, giving each other project ideas, reviewing each others code, notifying each other of job / internship opportunities, problem solving, debugging, and really anything that could help either of us improve. 

Feel free to reach me on discord @ChristopherPool#3641
