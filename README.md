Hi, my name is Christopher Pool and I’m interested in full-stack web development.

I’m currently learning front-end development. While I have a good base knowledge of how to make a front-end website, I'm specifically trying to improve on UX, best practices, and optimization at the moment. As well as other more specific front-sided things such as forms, video players, SEO, search algorithms, API post requests, and more. 

Feel free to reach out to me @ chrispool228@gmail.com
