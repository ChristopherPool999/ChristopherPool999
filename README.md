Hello, my name is Chris Pool, nice to meet you! I am working towards becoming a front-end, and eventually full-stack, web developer. 

Currently I spend most of my time building front-sided websites in hopes of an internship or even possibly a permanent role in the near future ðŸ˜…. 

Please take a look at some of my projects! It's very encouraging knowing employers are willing to take them into consideration which really helps motivate me to continue learning and trying to be the best I can be! 

Hopefully we might be able to work together some time in the future. Thanks again for checking out my Github!
